# WeatherForecastApp
This project involves the development of a Weather Forecast Application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (with Tailwind CSS for styling). The primary goal is to create a user-friendly application that allows users to search for weather information by city name or by their current location.
The Weather Forecast Application is a simple and intuitive tool built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (with Tailwind CSS for styling). It retrieves real-time weather data from a weather API to provide users with accurate and location-based weather forecasts. Users can search for weather by city name or by using their current location, and view a 5-day extended forecast.


Features:-
Location-based Weather: Search for the weather by city name or get the weather for your current location using the Geolocation API.
Extended 5-Day Forecast: View the weather forecast for the next 5 days, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions.
Recent Searches Dropdown: Store and display recently searched cities in a dropdown menu.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use input fields, buttons, and weather icons for a pleasant user experience.
Responsive Design: Fully responsive to work on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Technologies Used:-
HTML5 for structuring the app.
CSS and Tailwind CSS for styling.
JavaScript for functionality and API integration.
WeatherAPI or OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data.
